        'The stock price of Tesla (TSLA) has decreased due to the sudden departure of Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, from OpenAI, an artificial intelligence research lab. Musk\'s exit from OpenAI has raised concerns among investors about potential disruptions in the strategic direction of Tesla, given the increasing importance of AI in the automotive industry. This uncertainty has led to a decrease in investor confidence, resulting in a drop in Tesla\'s stock price.\n' +
        'The decrease in Tesla\'s stock price (TSLA) can be attributed to the recent news about the company\'s electric vehicles (EVs) not being as cost-effective as initially thought. The report suggests that the total cost of ownership, which includes factors like insurance, maintenance, and electricity, may be higher for Tesla\'s EVs compared to traditional gas-powered cars. This could potentially deter consumers from purchasing Tesla\'s vehicles, thereby affecting the company\'s sales and profitability, which in turn, impacts its stock price negatively.'
